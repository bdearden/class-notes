    <exercise>
      <statement>

        <p>
          Let <m>A = \{a, b, c, d\}</m>. Find <m>\pow(A)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          We are looking for a set containing 16 sets.

    <exercise>
      <statement>

        <p>
          Let <m>A = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>. Find all sets <m>B \in \pow(A)</m> which have the property <m>\{2,3,5\} \subseteq B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <!-- the following comes from https://github.com/oscarlevin/discrete-book -->
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find an example of sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> such that <m>|A| = 4</m>, <m>|B| = 5</m>, and <m>|A \cup B| = 9</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          For example, <m>A = \{1,2,3,4\}</m> and <m>B = \{5,6,7,8,9\}</m> gives <m>A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}</m>.
        </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Are there sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> such that <m>|A| = |B|</m>, <m>|A\cup B| = 10</m>, and <m>|A\cap B| = 5</m>? Explain.

      <statement>

        <p>
          In a regular deck of playing cards there are 26 red cards and 12 face cards. Explain, using sets and what you have learned about cardinalities, why there are only 32 cards which are either red or a face card.
