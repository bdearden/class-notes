<p>Tommy Flanagan was telling you what he ate yesterday afternoon. He tells you, “I had either popcorn or raisins. Also, if I had cucumber sandwiches, then I had soda. But I didn't drink soda or tea.” Of course you know that Tommy is the worlds worst liar, and everything he says is false. What did Tommy eat?</p>
<p>Justify your answer by writing all of Tommy's statements using sentence variables (\(P, Q, R, S, T\)), taking their negations, and using these to deduce what Tommy actually ate.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-logic-equivalences.html#exercise-15">in-context</a></span>
