      <statement>
        <p>
          A standard deck of playing cards contains four <term>suits</term> (spade, heart, club, diamond). There are 13 cards in each suit (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). <term>Face cards</term> refers to jacks, queens, and kings. Spades and clubs are black and hearts and diamonds are red.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>multiplicative principle</term> states that if an event <m>A</m> can occur <m>m</m> ways and an event <m>n</m> can occur <n>n</n> ways, then the event <q><m>A \and B</m></q> can occur <m>m\cdot n</m> ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The multiplicative principle generalizes to more than two events.
        </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If in your closet you have five ironic t-shirts, three pairs of pants, and three collegiate hats, how many different outfits do you have? Here an outfit is pants, shirt, hat.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many six character license plates can there be if the first three characters are letters and the second three characters are numbers? 
        </p>
      </statement>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many playing cards in a standard deck are both red and face cards?

    </example>


    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>additive principle</term> states that if event <m>A</m> can occur <m>m</m> ways and event <m>B</m> can occur <m>n</m> ways and the two events are disjoint, then the event <q><m>A \text{ or } B</m></q> can occur <m>m + n</m> ways.

      <title>Counting principles in terms of sets:</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A \and B</m> be two sets. Then:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>|A \times B| = |A| \cdot |B|</m>.

      <title>The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>A \and B</m> are two sets, then <m>|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that this is like the additive principle, except we're removing the occurances that are in common between <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>


    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
           Suppose a company receives 350 applications from college graduates for a job. Suppose 220 of these applicants majored in computer science, 147 majored in business, and 51 majored in both computer science and business. How many majored in neither computer science nor business? 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many bit strings of length eight either start with a 1 bit or end with two bits 00? 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>



    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          There are 30 people in a club. Assuming everyone is qualified to serve in any position, how many different ways are there to assign a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>


    <note>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion applies to more than two sets. For any finite sets <m>A, B, \and C</m>,
          <me> |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </note>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose we surveyed a class of 41 students, asking if they could play an Accordion, a Bassoon, or a Clarinet. 12 could play the clarinet, 8 could play bassoon, and 5 the accordian. 6 played clarinet and bassoon, 2 played clarinet and accordion, and 3 played bassoon and accordion. One student played all three. 
        </p>
        <p>
          How many students can play at least one instrument? Solve this first by Venn Diagrams, then by PIE.

            We usually write numbers in decimal form (or base 10), meaning numbers are composed using 10 different <q>digits</q> <m>\{0,1,\ldots, 9\}</m>. Sometimes though it is useful to write numbers <term>hexadecimal</term> or base 16. Now there are 16 distinct digits that can be used to form numbers: <m>\{0, 1, \ldots, 9, \mathrm{A, B, C, D, E, F}\}</m>. So for example, a 3 digit hexadecimal number might be 2B8.
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  How many 2-digit hexadecimals are there in which the first digit is E or F? Explain your answer in terms of the additive principle (using either events or sets).

        Let's arrange the binomial coefficients <m>{n \choose k}</m> into a triangle like follows:
      </p>
    <sidebyside width="80%">
      <image xml:id="pascal-small">
        <latex-image>
          \begin{tikzpicture}
  \def\r{.5}

  % Pascal's triangle
  %put row of 1's down left side:
    \foreach \row in {0,...,7} {
      \hexbox{\row}{0}{ 1}
    }
  %fill in the rest of the triangle:
    \foreach \row in {1,...,7} {
      \pgfmathsetmacro{\entry}{1};
      \foreach \col in {1,...,\row} {
        % iterative formula : val = precval * (row-col+1)/col
        % (+ 0.5 to bypass rounding errors)
       \pgfmathtruncatemacro{\entry}{\entry*((\row-\col+1)/\col)+0.5};
        \global\let\entry=\entry
        \ifnum \entry&lt;100
  	\hexbox{\row}{\col}{\entry}
        \else \ifnum \entry&lt;1000
  	\hexbox{\row}{\col}{\footnotesize \entry}
        \else \ifnum \entry&lt;10000
  	\hexbox{\row}{\col}{\footnotesize \entry}
  	\else
  	\hexbox{\row}{\col}{\scriptsize \entry}
  	\fi
        \fi
        \fi
      }
    }
  \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>
      </image>
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      There are lots of patterns hidden away in the triangle, enough to fill a reasonably sized book. Here are just a few of the most obvious ones:

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The entries on the border of the triangle are all 1.
          <me>\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1</me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        Any entry not on the border is the sum of the two entries above it.
        <me>\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}</me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        The triangle is symmetric.  In any row, entries on the left side are mirrored on the right side.
        <me> \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n - k}</me>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        The sum of all entries on a given row is a power of 2. 
        <me> \binom{n}0 + \binom{n}1 + \binom{n}2 + \dots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n</me>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

          In how many ways can you tile a 5-board? 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that a 5-board is just a 4-board with an extra space. How many ways are there to tile this? There are 5 ways to tile a 4-board and all we're doing is adding an extra square. There's <m>5\cdot1 = 1</m> ways to do this. 
        </p>
        <p>
          ... but a 5-board is also a 3-board with an extra two spaces at the end. How many ways can we tile this? Well, there are 3 ways to tile the three board, and we just add a domino.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two subdivisions are mutually exclusive (if we added a square to the 3-board, that's turned it into the 4-board, which was already counted above). So we can conclude the number of ways to tile a 5-board is 5+3 = 8.

          Question: <q>How many tilings of an <m>n</m>-board exist?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 1: There are <m>f_n</m> tilings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 2: Condition on the number of dominoes. If there are no dominoes, then from <m>n</m> cells, we have 0 choices for where to put the domino: <m>\binom{n}{0}</m>. For 1 domino, we will be using a total of <m>n-2</m> squares and domino which will span the remaining two locations. That means that we are using a total of <m>n-1</m> tiles, and so we have <m>\binom{n-1}{1}</m> possibilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For the case where we are using <m>i</m> dominoes, with <m>0\le i \le n/2</m>, we will be using  <m>n-2i</m> squares, or a total of <m>n-2i + i = n-i</m> tiles. To choose where to place the <m>i</m> dominoes, we'll have <m>\binom{n-i}{i}</m> ways to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, there are a total of <m>n \ge 0, \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n-n}{n}</m> tilings of an <m>n</m> board.
