    <!--       The game TENZI comes with 40 six-sided dice (each numbered 1 to 6). Suppose you roll all 40 dice. -->

    <!--         <li> Prove that there will be at least seven dice that land on the same number.</li> -->

    <!--           <p> -->
    <!--             How many dice would you have to roll before you were guaranteed that some four of them would all match or all be different? Prove your answer. -->

    <!--             This is an example of the pigeonhole principle. We can prove it by contrapositive. -->
    <!--           </p> -->

    <!--           <proof> -->
    <!--             <p> -->
    <!--               Suppose that each number only came up 6 or fewer times. So there are at most six 1's, six 2's, and so on. That's a total of 36 dice, so you must not have rolled all 40 dice. -->

    <!--           </proof> -->
    <!--         </li> -->

    <!--         <li> -->
    <!--           <p> -->
    <!--             We can have 9 dice without any four matching or any four being all different: three 1's, three 2's, three 3's. We will prove that whenever you roll 10 dice, you will always get four matching or all being different. -->
    <!--           </p> -->

    <!--           <proof> -->
    <!--             <p> -->
    <!--               Suppose you roll 10 dice, but that there are NOT four matching rolls. This means at most, there are three of any given value. If we only had three different values, that would be only 9 dice, so there must be 4 different values, giving 4 dice that are all different. -->

            Use induction to prove that <m>\d\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n</m>. That is, the sum of the <m>n</m>th row of Pascal's Triangle is <m>2^n</m>.

            Use induction to prove <m>{4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+n \choose n} = {5+n \choose n}</m>. (This is an example of the hockey stick theorem.)

            Find the largest number of points which a football team cannot get exactly using just 3-point field goals and 7-point touchdowns (ignore the possibilities of safeties, missed extra points, and two point conversions). Prove your answer is correct by mathematical induction.
