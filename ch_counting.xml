          Let's imagine that you have a rectangular grid of blank spaces. How many ways can you tile that grid using either square tiles or two-square-wide dominos.

        <p>
          In how many ways can you tile a 5-board? 
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that a 5-board is just a 4-board with an extra space. How many ways are there to tile this? There are 5 ways to tile a 4-board and all we're doing is adding an extra square. There's <m>5\cdot1 = 1</m> ways to do this. 
        </p>
        <p>
          ... but a 5-board is also a 3-board with an extra two spaces at the end. How many ways can we tile this? Well, there are 3 ways to tile the three board, and we just add a domino.
        </p>
        <p>
          These two subdivisions are mutually exclusive (if we added a square to the 3-board, that's turned it into the 4-board, which was already counted above). So we can conclude the number of ways to tile a 5-board is 5+3 = 8.

          Question: <q>How many tilings of an <m>n</m>-board exist?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 1: There are <m>f_n</m> tilings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Answer 2: Condition on the number of dominoes. If there are no dominoes, then from <m>n</m> cells, we have 0 choices for where to put the domino: <m>\binom{n}{0}</m>. For 1 domino, we will be using a total of <m>n-2</m> squares and domino which will span the remaining two locations. That means that we are using a total of <m>n-1</m> tiles, and so we have <m>\binom{n-1}{1}</m> possibilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For the case where we are using <m>i</m> dominoes, with <m>0\le i \le n/2</m>, we will be using  <m>n-2i</m> squares, or a total of <m>n-2i + i = n-i</m> tiles. To choose where to place the <m>i</m> dominoes, we'll have <m>\binom{n-i}{i}</m> ways to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, there are a total of <m>n \ge 0, \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2} + \dots + \binom{n-n}{n}</m> tilings of an <m>n</m> board.
        </p>
      </solution>
