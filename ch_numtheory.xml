    <statement>
      <p>
        A positive integer <m>p</m> is called <term>prime</term> if the only positive factors of <m>p</m> are <m>1 \and p</m> itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A positive integer which is not prime is called <m>composite</m>
      </p>
    </statement>

  <note>
    <statement>
      <p>
        1 is neither prime nor composite. It's called a <term>unit</term>.

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>n</m> is a composite number, then <m>n</m> has a prime divisor less than or equal to <m>\sqrt{n}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assume, to the contrary, that every prime divisor of <m>n</m> is greater than <m>\sqrt{n}</m>. Since <m>n</m> is composite, it has at least two prime factors, <m>p_1, p_2</m> so that <m>n = p_1 p_2 b</m> where <m>b</m> is positive integer. But since <m>p_1 \and p_2</m> are a prime divisors of <m>n</m>, they are necessarily larger than  <m>\sqrt{n}</m>. So:
          <me> n = p_1  p_2  b \gt \sqrt{n} \cdot \sqrt{n} \cdot b = nb</me>
          But since <m>n</m> is composite and <m>b\in \Z^+</m>, <m>n\gt nb</m> is a contradiction.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proof>
  </theorem>

  <example>
    <title>Brute Force Trial Division</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        To determine if a number <m>n</m> is prime, one only needs to test all prime divisors up to <m>\sqrt{n}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use trial division to determine that 251 is prime.
