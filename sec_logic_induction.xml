  <p> TODO - write the section about induction. </p>

  <p> Write the first line. </p>
  <p> Assume that if I write up to k lines. Prove that if I have written n lines, then I can write n+1 lines.</p>

          What is wrong with the following <q>proof</q> that all horses are the same color?
        </p>
        <p>
          Proof by induction:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Base step: the statement <m>P(1)</m> is the statement <q>one horse is the same color as itself</q>. This is clearly true.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> Induction step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some integer <m>k</m>. That is, any group of <m>k</m> horses are all the same color.</p>
              <p> Consider a group of <m>k+1</m> horses. Let's line them up. If we look at first <m>k</m> horses, our induction hypothesis tells us they are the same color. Similarly, if we look at the last <m>k</m> horses, they are also the same color. This shows that all <m>k+1</m> horses are the same color.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Thus, by math induction, all horses are the same color.
