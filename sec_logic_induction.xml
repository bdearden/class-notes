        What is wrong with the following <q>proof</q> that all horses are the same color?
      </p>
      <p>
        Proof by induction:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> Base step: the statement <m>P(1)</m> is the statement <q>one horse is the same color as itself</q>. This is clearly true.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> Induction step: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some integer <m>k</m>. That is, any group of <m>k</m> horses are all the same color.</p>
            <p> Consider a group of <m>k+1</m> horses. Let's line them up. If we look at first <m>k</m> horses, our induction hypothesis tells us they are the same color. Similarly, if we look at the last <m>k</m> horses, they are also the same color. This shows that all <m>k+1</m> horses are the same color.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Thus, by math induction, all horses are the same color.

          Use induction to prove for all <m>n \in \N</m> that <m>\d\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>. Thus let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>, which claims that <m>1 = 2^{0+1} -1</m>. Since <m>2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1</m>, we see that <m>P(0)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>. That is, <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1</m>. We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true (i.e., that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} - 1</m>). To do this, we start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
            <md>
              <mrow> 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = \amp ~ 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} \amp \text{by inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> = \amp ~2\cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 \amp</mrow>
              <mrow> = \amp ~ 2^{k+2} - 1 \amp</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true so by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

          Prove that <m>7^n - 1</m> is a multiple of 6 for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q><m>7^n - 1</m> is a multiple of 6.</q> We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>. Since <m>7^0 - 1 = 0</m>, and <m>0</m> is a multiple of 6, <m>P(0)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> holds for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>. That is, <m>7^k - 1</m> is a multiple of 6, or in other words, <m>7^k - 1 = 6j</m> for some integer <m>j</m>. Now consider <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow> 7^{k+1} - 1 ~ \amp = 7^{k+1} - 7 + 6 \amp \text{by cleverness:} -1 = -7 + 6</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 7(7^k - 1) + 6 \amp \text{factor out a 7 from the first two terms}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 7(6j) + 6 \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 6(7j + 1) \amp \text{factor out a 6}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m> is a multiple of 6, or in other words, <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>. First the base case, <m>P(1)</m>. We have <m>1 = 1^2</m> which is true, so <m>P(1)</m> is established. Now the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some fixed arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>. That is, <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2</m>. We will now prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true (i.e., that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2</m>). We start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
            <md>
              <mrow> 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) + (2k+1) ~ \amp = k^2 + (2k+1) \amp \text{by ind. hyp.}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = (k+1)^2 \amp \text{by factoring}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> holds, so by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>2^n \lt  n!</m>. We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>. First, we check the base case and see that yes, <m>2^4 \lt  4!</m> (as <m>16 \lt  24</m>) so <m>P(4)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \ge 4</m>. That is, <m>2^k \lt  k!</m>. Now consider <m>P(k+1)</m>: <m>2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!</m>. To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement that <m>n + 3 = n + 7</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. Assume, for induction that <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>k+3 = k+7</m>. We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Now since <m>k + 3 = k + 7</m>, add 1 to both sides. This gives <m>k + 3 + 1 = k + 7 + 1</m>. Regrouping <m>(k+1) + 3 = (k+1) + 7</m>. But this is simply <m>P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

          Find the flaw in the following <q>proof</q> of the <q>fact</q> that <m>n \lt  100</m> for every <m>n \in \N</m>.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>n \lt  100</m>. We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case: when <m>n = 0</m>, <m>P(n)</m> is true, because <m>0 \lt  100</m>. Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>k \lt  100</m>. Now if <m>k \lt  100</m>, then <m>k</m> is some number, like 80. Of course <m>80+1 = 81</m> which is still less than 100. So <m>k +1 \lt  100</m> as well. But this is what <m>P(k+1)</m> claims, so we have shown that <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

          The problem here is that while <m>P(0)</m> is true, and while <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> for <em>some</em> values of <m>k</m>, there is at least one value of <m>k</m> (namely <m>k = 99</m>) when that implication fails. For a valid proof by induction, <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> must be true for all values of <m>k</m> greater than or equal to the base case.

          While the above proof does not work (it better not since the statement it is trying to prove is false!) we can prove something similar. Prove that there is a strictly increasing sequence <m>a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots</m> of numbers (not necessarily integers) such that <m>a_n \lt  100</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>. (By <term>strictly increasing</term> we mean <m>a_n \lt  a_{n+1}</m> for all <m>n</m>. So each term must be larger than the last.)

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>there is a strictly increasing sequence <m>a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n</m> with <m>a_n \lt  100</m>.</q> We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>. First we establish the base case: <m>P(1)</m> says there is a single number <m>a_1</m> with <m>a_1 \lt  100</m>. This is true <ndash/> take <m>a_1 = 0</m>. Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is there exists a strictly increasing sequence <m>a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_k</m> with <m>a_k \lt  100</m>. Now consider this sequence, plus one more term, <m>a_{k+1}</m> which is greater than <m>a_k</m> but less than <m>100</m>. Such a number exists, for example, the average between <m>a_k</m> and 100. So then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true, so we have shown that <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q><m>n^2 + n</m> is odd.</q> We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. Suppose for induction that <m>P(k)</m> is true, that is, that <m>k^2 + k</m> is odd. Now consider the statement <m>P(k+1)</m>. Now <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = k^2 + k + 2k + 2</m>. By the inductive hypothesis, <m>k^2 + k</m> is odd, and of course <m>2k + 2</m> is even. An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore <m>(k+1)^2 + (k+1)</m> is odd.

      <solution>
        <p>
          The idea is to define the sequence so that <m>a_n</m> is less than the distance between the previous partial sum and 2. That way when you add it into the next partial sum, the partial sum is still less than 2. You could do this ahead of time, or use a clever <m>P(n)</m> in the induction proof.

            Inductive case: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for all <m>k \lt n</m>. Now if <m>n</m> is a power of 2, we are done. If not, let <m>2^x</m> be the largest power of 2 strictly less than <m>n</m>.  Consider <m>n - 2^x</m>, which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both <m>n</m> and <m>2^x</m>. Thus <m>n-2^x</m> is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be <m>2^x</m>, so the together with <m>2^x</m> we have written <m>n</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2.

            Therefore, by the principle of (strong) mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Use induction to prove that if <m>n</m> people all shake hands with each other, that the total number of handshakes is <m>\frac{n(n-1)}{2}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>when <m>n</m> people shake hands with each other, there are a total of <m>\frac{n(n-1)}{2}</m> handshakes.</q>
          </p>

          <p>
            Base case: When <m>n=2</m>, there will be one handshake, and <m>\frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1</m>.  Thus <m>P(2)</m> is true.
          </p>
        <p>
            Inductive case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for arbitrary <m>k\ge 2</m> (that the number of handshakes among <m>k</m> people is <m>\frac{k(k-1)}{2}</m>.  What happens if a <m>k+1</m>st person shows up?  How many <em>new</em> handshakes take place?  The new person must shake hands with everyone there, which is <m>k</m> new  handshakes.  So the total is now <m>\frac{k(k-1)}{2} + k = \frac{(k+1)k}{2}</m>, as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.
