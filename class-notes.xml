          The WSU Catalog says of this course: 
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              MATH 321.  Discrete Structures I
            </p>
            <p>
            Cross-listed as CS 321. Provides a mathematical foundation essential to the entire computer science curriculum. Includes propositional and predicate logic, induction, recursion and counting techniques. Prerequisite: MATH 242 or equivalent with a grade point of 2.000 or better.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

        <p>
          We'll be exploring these areas, along with enough number theory to do an interesting application to encryption. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This course is very different that your past math courses. Keep an open mind, and as my son has said, <q>try. Fail. Try. Fail. Try. Succeed!</q> And please ask questions. This might be the <q>hardest</q> math class you take, but it can also be one of the most rewarding.

        This book borrows heavily from the exercises of Oscar Levin's <url href="https://github.com/oscarlevin/discrete-book">Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction</url>.

          The material in section <xref ref="section-counting-fib"/> was first discovered in Arthur Benjamin and Jennifer Quinn's <pubtitle>Proofs that Really Count: The Art of Combinatorial Proof</pubtitle>, and the exercises in that section come from that book, and influenced every choice of Fibonacci sequence problem in the remainder of the text.

          I'm also grateful for you, reader, as we go on this journey of mathematics together. This is going to be fun.

    <!--
        I wanted to put my thoughts on the ordering of the material somewhere, so I've chosen to place it in this comment. I will likely wonder in future semesters why I ordered the material in this way, and here I hope to address future me:
        .
        A note on the ordering of the content:
        1. The course begins with logic, as it underlies everything that we do
        a. It needs to precede set theory, so that by the time they can connect set operations to the Boolean properties
        b. It should include mathematical induction, because that technique is used frequently through the course
        2. Mathematical objects comes second - we need things on which to operate
        a. Sets must necessarily precede functions
        b. Matrices don't quite make sense in the rest of the course, but it's there so we're ready for boolean matrices and relations later in Discrete 2.
        c. Sequences come next as they're functions on a subset of N
        d. We solve recurrences, including induction techniques as well as two-dimensional linear homogenous sequences
        3. Number theory comes next
        a. We're exploring properties of sets of numbers
        b. We employ number theoretic functions
        c. We are using general proof and induction techniques
        4. Counting comes at the end
        - counting could reasonably come anywhere in the course, but I've chosen to include it at the end when we can then count via basic techniques, but also via recursion (and induction).

        * This follows, in some sense, an outline of the Rosen text I've used for the previous three iterations of the course. However, I chose to move around material (namely induction and solving recurrences) so that I can employ those techniques throughout the course, rather than waiting for the end (induction was chapter 5, after number theory!)
