          The WSU Catalog says of this course: 
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              MATH 321.  Discrete Structures I
            </p>
            <p>
            Cross-listed as CS 321. Provides a mathematical foundation essential to the entire computer science curriculum. Includes propositional and predicate logic, induction, recursion and counting techniques. Prerequisite: MATH 242 or equivalent with a grade point of 2.000 or better.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll be exploring these areas, along with enough number theory to do an interesting application to encryption. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This course is very different that your past math courses. Keep an open mind, and as my son has said, <q>try. Fail. Try. Fail. Try. Succeed!</q> And please ask questions. This might be the <q>hardest</q> math class you take, but it can also be one of the most rewarding.

          I'm also grateful for you, reader, as we go on this journey of mathematics together. This is going to be fun.
