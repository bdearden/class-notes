  <definition>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be two non-empty sets. A <term>function (or mapping) from the set <m>A</m> to the set <m>B</m></term> is an assignment of exactly one element from <m>B</m> each element of the set <m>A</m>. 
      <!-- Note: wrestled with the definition being as written vs being a subset of AxB.  I decided the definition as written is preferable in so far as we're transitioning our students from calculus where this definition is the most familiar. -->
      <ul>
        <li>We denote this by <m>f:A\to B</m></li>
        <li>If <m>b\in B</m> is the unique element assigned to <m>a\in A</m>, we write <m>f(a)=b</m></li>
        <li>We call the set <m>A</m> the <term>domain</term> of the function, and the set <m>B</m> the <term>codomain</term> of the function. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>f(a) = b</m>, we call
      <ul>
        <li><m>b</m> is the <term>image</term> of <m>a</m> under the mapping</li>
        <li><m>a</m> is the <term>preimage</term> of <m>b</m> under the mapping</li>
      </ul>
      and we define the <term>range</term> of the function <m>f</m> to be the set of images of every element in the domain, <m>A</m>, and often write the range by <m>f(A)</m>. Note that the range is a subset of the codomain, <m>f(A)\subseteq B</m>.
    </p>
  </definition>

  <note>
    <p>
      A function has two pieces of information:
      <ol>
        <li> Specification of two sets, the domain and codomain </li>
        <li> A mapping between those two sets </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this class, we will be using a variety of ways of describing the domain and codomain of a function, from writing <m>f:A \to B</m> to describing them in words.
    </p>
  </note>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the domain, codomain, and range of the following functions:
        <ol>
          <li>Let <m>f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}</m> be defined by <m>f(x)=x^2</m></li>
          <li>Let <m>g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m> be defined by <m>g(x)=x^2</m></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <p>
      A function <m>f</m> is said to be  <term>injective</term> or <term>one-to-one</term> if and only if <m>f(a) = f(b)</m> means that <m>a = b</m> for all <m>a \text{ and } b</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>. 
      <me>
        f \text{ is injective means }  \forall a, b ((f(a) = f(b)) \to (a = b))
      </me>
    </p>
  </definition>

  <note>
    <p>
      To determine if a function <m>f: A \to B</m> is injective, we show that if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> for arbitrary values <m>x, y \in A</m> with <m>x \not= y</m>, we conclude <m>x=y</m>. (A direct proof).
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine if a function <m>f: A \to B</m> is not injective, we find particular elements <m>x, y \in A</m> such that <m>x \not= y</m> but <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> (a counterexample!)
    </p>
  </note>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine if the following functions are injective. If so, prove it. If not, provide a specific counterexample showing that it is not.
      <ol>
        <li>Let <m>f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m> be defined by <m>f(x) = 2x-1</m>.</li>
        <li>Let <m>g(x) = x^2</m> be the mapping from <m>\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <definition>
    <p>
      A function <m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is said to be <term>surjective</term> or <term>onto</term> if and only if for every element <m>b \in B</m>, there is an element <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f(a) = B</m>. 
      <me>
        f \text{ is surjective means } \forall y\in B\,\, \exists x\in A \,\, ( y = f(x) ) 
      </me>
    </p>
  </definition>

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine if the following functions are surjective. If so, prove it. If not, provide a specific counterexample showing that it is not.
      <ol>
        <li>Let <m>f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m> be defined by <m>f(x) = 2x-1</m>.</li>
        <li>Let <m>g(x) = x^2</m> be the mapping from <m>\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>.</li>
        <li>Let <m>g(x) = x^3</m> be the mapping from <m>\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}</m>.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <note>
    <p>If a function is onto, the range is exactly the codomain </p>
    <p>
      To determine if a function <m>f: A \to B</m> is surjective, we show that given an arbitrary element <m>y \in B</m> we can find an element <m>x\in A</m> such that <m>f(x)=y</m>. (A direct proof).
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine if a function <m>f: A \to B</m> is not surjective, we find a particular element <m>y \in B</m> such that <m>f(x) \not= y</m> for all <m>x\in A</m> (a counterexample!)
    </p>
  </note>

  <definition>
    <p>
      A function <m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is said to be a <term>one-to-one correspondance</term> or <term>bijective</term> if it is both injective and surjective.
    </p>
  </definition>

  <example xml:id="example-bijections">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Determine if the following are bijections from <m>\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}</m>:
        <ol>
          <li><m>f(x) = -3x^2 + 7</m></li>
          <li><m>f(x) = x^5 + 1</m></li>

        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>


  <definition>
    <p>
      Let <m>f:A \to B</m> be a bijection. The <term>inverse function</term> of <m>f</m> is the unique function that assigns to each element <m>b\in B</m> a unique element <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>f(a) = b</m>. We denote the inverse by <m>f^{-1}</m> so that
        <me>f^{-1} : B \to A \text{ where }  f^{-1}(b) = a \iff f(a) = b</me>

        For the bijection(s) found in example <xref ref="example-bijections"/>, find the inverse function.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Restrict the domain and/or codomain so that <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m> is invertible. Verify your answer is correct.

  <!-- <definition> -->
  <!--   <p> -->
  <!--     If <m>f_1:A \to \mathbb{R}</m> and <m>f_2:A \to \mathbb{R}</m>, then for any <m>x\in A</m>: -->

  <definition>
    <p>
      The <term>floor</term> function assigns to every real number <m>x</m> the largest integer that is less than or equal to <m>x</m>. We denote by this <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m>
      <me>\lfloor \cdot \rfloor : \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{Z} \text{ with } (\lfloor x \rfloor = n) \iff (n \le x \lt n + 1)</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <term>ceiling</term> function assigns to every real number <m>x</m> the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to <m>x</m>. We denote by this <m>\lceil x \rceil</m>
      <me>\lceil \cdot \rceil : \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{Z} \text{ with } (\lceil x \rceil = n) \iff (n - 1 \lt x \le n)</me>

            <li><m>f</m> is not injective. To prove this, we must simply find two different elements of the domain which map to the same element of the codomain. Since <m>f(\{1\}) = 1</m> and <m>f(\{2\}) = 1</m>, we see that <m>f</m> is not injective.</li>
            <li><m>f</m> is not surjective. The largest subset of <m>A</m> is <m>A</m> itself, and <m>|A| = 10</m>. So no natural number greater than 10 will ever be an output.</li>

            <li><p><m>f</m> is injective.</p>

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be elements of the domain <m>\Z</m>. Assume <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even, then <m>f(x) = x+1</m> and <m>f(y) = y+1</m>. Since <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>, we have <m>x + 1 = y + 1</m> which implies that <m>x = y</m>. Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd, then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>. The only other possibility is that <m>x</m> is even an <m>y</m> is odd (or visa-versa). But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd and <m>y - 3</m> would be even, so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. Therefore if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>, which proves that <m>f</m> is injective.

            <li><p><m>f</m> is surjective.</p>

                Let <m>y</m> be an element of the codomain <m>\Z</m>. We will show there is an element <m>n</m> of the domain (<m>\Z</m>) such that <m>f(n) = y</m>. There are two cases: First, if <m>y</m> is even, then let <m>n = y+3</m>. Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m> is odd, so <m>f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y</m> as desired. Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n = y-1</m>. Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even, so <m>f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y</m> as needed. Therefore <m>f</m> is surjective.

          At the end of the semester a teacher assigns letter grades to each of her students. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Yes, this is a function, if you choose the domain and codomain correctly. The domain will be the set of students, and the codomain will be the set of possible grades. The function is almost certainly not injective, because it is likely that two students will get the same grade. The function might be surjective <ndash/> it will be if there is at least one student who gets each grade.
