    Solving Recurrence Relations
  </title>

  <subsection>
    <title>Motivation, AKA, why do I care?</title>
    <p>
      Let's imagine that we wanted to find the 10,000th term of the sequence <m>a_n = a_{n-2}</m> with <m>a_0 =1, a_1 = 3</m>. The sequence is very simple: <m>\{1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, \dots\}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that the solution to this recurrence is <m>a_n = 2+(-1)^{n+1}</m>. We can directly compute the value, and it takes SageMath about 150 microseconds to give us the answer:
      <sage>
        <input>
          %%time
          def nonrec(x): return 2 + pow(-1, x+1);
          print(nonrec(10000))
        </input>
        <output>
          1
          CPU times: user 111 µs, sys: 57 µs, total: 168 µs
          Wall time: 144 µs
        </output>
      </sage>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      But if we wanted to actually have the computer find the 10,000th value via the recursive definition, Sage (computing via Python) can't even do it:
      <sage>
        <input>
          %%time
          def recursive(x):
              if x == 0:
                  return 1;
              elif x == 1:
                  return 3;
              else:
                  return recursive(x-2)
              
          print(recursive(10000))
        </input>
        <output>
          RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
        </output>
      </sage>
    </p>
    <p>
      Explicit solutions are better when we want to be able to actually determine specific values of a recurrence.

      The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle with the goal of moving all disks from one peg to another peg. The puzzle has the following rules:
      <ol>
        <li> Place all the disks on the first peg in order of size with the largest on bottom.</li>
        <li> Move one disk at a time to any other peg. A move is valid only if a smaller disk is placed on top a larger one.</li>
      </ol>

        <p>
          Let <m>H_n</m> denote the number of moves to solve the puzzle with <m>n</m> disks. Our goal is to find a solution to the sequence <m>\{H_n\}</m>.
          <ol>
            <li>What is the recurrence relation that describes <m>H_n</m> in terms of previous values?</li>
            <li>Solve the recurrence relation.</li>
            <li>The story accompanying the puzzle says that monks are currently solving the puzzle with 64 golden disks, and that the world will end when they finally solve the puzzle. Should we be concerned? Why or why not?</li>

          Recall that a bitstring is a string containing only 0's and 1's. How many bitstrings of length <m>n</m> do not contain three consecutive 0's?

        <p>
          Find a recurrence relation for <m>C_n</m>, the number of ways to parenthesize the product of <m>n+1</m> numbers
          <me>x_0\cdot x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot \dots \cdot x_n</me>
          to determine the order of multiplication.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sequence <m>\{C_n\}</m> is the sequence of Catalan numbers. We will revisit them in homework and again briefly in Math 322.

          For the purposes of this learning the concept, we will restrict ourselves to degree two recurrences. This means the characteristic equations are quadratic and can be easily solved. The same process would apply if the characteristic equation were of higher degree - it's just that solving those equations isn't straightforward, and takes away from focusing on the new material.
